# VBSprojects
Here is some of my vbs code what i had made.

There are three files.
1. pasteTextToDoc.vbs
IT WILL PASTE YOUR SELECTED FILE TO THE .DOC 
ONLY ADD YOUR PATH TO THE FILE

2. SaveScreenShotToDoc
IT WILL MAKE SCREENSHOT OF YOUR WINDOW AND SAVE IT TO THE .DOC FILE
ONLY ADD YOUR FILE PATH

3. ScreenCopy.vbs
IT WILL DO ONLY SCREEN SHOT OF YOUR SCREEN.
YOU CAN THEN PAST IT WHERE YOU WANT BY USING "CTR + V" COMMAND




ADD NOTE:
You have there two options of doing screenshot one is full scale secent is only selected window

'FULL SCREEN
oWordBasic.SendKeys "{prtsc}"

'ONLY selected wondow
'oWordBasic.SendKeys "%{prtsc}"

by changing that you will have different results.
